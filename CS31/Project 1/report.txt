step 5 - inputs:
	-Typing a negative number for one of the values will result in a negative voting percentage, which does not make sense.
	-Typing a 0 for all three inputs results in the percents being displayed as "-1.$%" because the program will end up dividing by zero if 'numberSurveyed' is set to zero.

Step 6 - logic_error.cpp:
	-Added a negative sign before the 'numberSurveyed' variable when calculating 'pctJerry'
	-Inserting a negative sign before the 'numberSurveyed' variable when calculating 'pctJerry' causes the 'pctJerry' variable to be negative when using reasonable inputs and therefore the program displays a negative percent for the amount of people that will vote for Jerry, which does not make sense.

Setp 7 - compile_error.cpp:
	-Removed a semicolon from the end of a cout statement
	-Removed the 'forMeg' variable declaration
	-The first error reported is that there is a semicolon missing because I removed it
	-There are three more errors about an undeclared identifier "forMeg" because the "forMeg" variable is referenced three times throughout the program, but it was never declared.
