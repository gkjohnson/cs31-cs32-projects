a:
This program was not very difficult. The only problem I had was becoming familiar with the function getline because this was my first time using it in a program.

b:
("",100,"teacher",20) - test that program displays that the user must enter a name
("Garrett",-1000,"teacher",0) - test that program displays that taxable income must be nonnegative
("Garrett",1000,"",0) - test that program displays that user must enter an occupation
("Garrett",1000,"teacher",-5) - test that program displays that the amount of children must be nonnegative

("",-1000,"",-5) - test that the no name error takes precedence over other three errors and is displayed correctly
("Garrett",-1000,"",-5) - test that negative income error take precedence over other two errors and is displayed correctly
("Garrett", 1000,"",-5) - test that no occupation error takes precedence negative children error

("Garrett",100,"teacher",20) - test that final tax will not go below zero

("Garrett J",100,"Math Professor",0) - verify that the program can handle the name and occupation properly if they consist of more than one word

("Garrett",100,"teacher",0) - test that tax for income under $50000 calculates properly (%4)
("Garrett",100,"engineer",0) - test that "engineer" occupation does not affect tax for income under $50000
("Garrett",100,"scientist",0) - test that "scientist" occupation does not affect tax for income under $50000
("Garrett",50000,"teacher",0) - test that the tax is calculated properly when income is on the edge of the lower tier
("Garrett",40000,"teacher",2) - test that the program handles children properly under $50000
("Garrett",50000,"teacher",2) - test that the program handles children properly when equal to $50000

("Garrett",60000,"teacher",0) - test that tax for income between $50000 and $120000 calculates properly
("Garrett",60000,"engineer",0) - test that "engineer" occupation only affects the income amount between $50000 and $120000
("Garrett",60000,"scientist",0) - test that "scientist" occupation only affects the income amount between $50000 and $120000
("Garrett",120000,"teacher",0) - test that the tax is calculated properly when income is on the edge of the middle tier
("Garrett",60000,"teacher",2) - test that the program handles children properly under $120000
("Garrett",120000,"teacher",1000) - test that the program does not subract tax for children when income is equal to $120000

("Garrett",130000,"teacher",0) - test that tax for income above $120000 calculates properly
("Garrett",130000,"engineer",0) - test that "engineer" occupation only affects the income amount between $50000 and $120000
("Garrett",130000,"scientist",0) - test that "scientist" occupation only affects the income amount between $50000 and $120000
("Garrett",130000,"teacher",1000) - test that the program does not subract tax for children when income is over $120000
